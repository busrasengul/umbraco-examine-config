The simplest way to configure Examine in Umbraco 8!

In Umbraco 7 Examine was configured via the friendly `ExamineIndexes.config` and `ExamineSettings.config` config files. However in Umbraco 8 this configuration has moved into code, making it more difficult to configure Examine as desired. This project aims to replicate many of the helpful features of the Umbraco 7 Examine config files within Umbraco 8.

## Getting started

This package is supported on Umbraco 8.4+.

Most of the core functionality is provided by [Examine.Config](https://github.com/callumbwhyte/examine-config), with some Umbraco specific options sprinkled on top.

### Installation

The package is available from Our Umbraco, NuGet, or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

#### Our Umbraco repository

You can find a downloadable package, along with a discussion forum for this package, on the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/projects/developer-tools/examine-config/) site.

#### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.ExamineConfig/), run the following command in your instance of Visual Studio.

    PM> Install-Package Our.Umbraco.ExamineConfig

## Usage

The package can be used to configure settings for the "Internal", "External" and "Media" Examine indexes in Umbraco.

It is possible to configure the following settings per index:

| Name                    | Type    | Default    |
|-------------------------|---------|------------|
| ParentId                | Integer | `-1`       |
| IncludeItemTypes        | Array   | Everything |
| ExcludeItemTypes        | Array   | Nothing    |
| SupportProtectedContent | Boolean | `false`    |

Settings are configured within the appsettings section of your `web.config` file for your Umbraco install. Appsetting names follow a convention of: `Umbraco.Examine.{INDEX-NAME}.{SETTING-NAME}`.

For example, to enable `SupportProtectedContent` for the "External" the name would be `Umbraco.Examine.ExternalIndex.SupportProtectedContent`.
